            <p>Effective Date: June 2025</p>

            <h2>1. Digital Products Are Non-Refundable</h2>
            <p>
                Due to the digital nature of our products, all sales are final. Once the product (e.g., Shopify code snippets) has been accessed or delivered, we cannot offer refunds, exchanges, or cancellations.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Access Issues or Technical Problems</h2>
            <p>
                If you experience any issues accessing or using the purchased product, please contact our support team. We will do our best to resolve any technical issues promptly.
            </p>

            <h2>3. Duplicate Purchases</h2>
            <p>
                In the event of an accidental duplicate purchase, please notify us within 7 days. After verification, we may issue a partial or full refund at our discretion.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Unauthorized Transactions</h2>
            <p>
                If you believe your payment was unauthorized or fraudulent, please contact us immediately. We will investigate the claim and work with you to find a resolution.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Service Packages Policy</h2>
            <p>
                Our service packages (such as Basic, Professional, and Advanced plans) are custom digital services that involve consultation, development, and design work tailored specifically to each customer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once a package is purchased and our team begins communication, planning, or development, the service is considered initiated and is therefore non-refundable.
            </p>
            <p>
                We encourage customers to carefully review the details of each package before purchasing. If you&#39;re uncertain which plan best suits your needs, feel free to <a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send/?phone=905525909960&text&type=phone_number&app_absent=0" target="_blank">contact us on WhatsApp</a> for guidance.
            </p>
